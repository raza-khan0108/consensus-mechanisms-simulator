# 🧠 Consensus Mechanisms Simulator

This project simulates three major blockchain consensus mechanisms: **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**, **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**, and **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)**. It demonstrates how different validators are selected in each consensus model using a simple JavaScript-based mock environment.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🧮 Simulates PoW by selecting the validator with the highest computational power.
- 💰 Simulates PoS by selecting the validator with the highest stake.
- 🗳️ Simulates DPoS by conducting elections where voters delegate their stake to delegates.
- 📊 Outputs validator details and selection logic in the console.
